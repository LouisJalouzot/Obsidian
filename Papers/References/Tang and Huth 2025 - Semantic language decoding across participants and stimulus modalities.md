“we tested whether language can be decoded from a goal participant without using any linguistic training data from that participant” (Tang and Huth, 2025, p. 2)

“We trained semantic decoders on brain responses from separate reference participants and then used functional alignment to transfer the decoders to the goal participant” (Tang and Huth, 2025, p. 2)

“Cross-participant decoder predictions were semantically related to the stimulus words, even when functional alignment was performed using movies with no linguistic content” (Tang and Huth, 2025, p. 2)

“Finally, we tested whether cross-participant decoders could be robust to lesions” (Tang and Huth, 2025, p. 2)

“by excluding brain regions from the goal participant prior to functional alignment” (Tang and Huth, 2025, p. 2)

“found that cross-participant decoders do not depend on data from any single brain region” (Tang and Huth, 2025, p. 2)
